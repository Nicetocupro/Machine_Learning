# Project: Machine Learning Lab Experiments

## Overview
This repository contains three lab experiments focused on machine learning techniques, implemented and documented with code and reports.

### Labs Included:
1. **Lab 1: Regression Experiment**  
   - Implementation of regression models and analysis of their performance.

2. **Lab 2: Classification Experiment**  
   - Classification techniques applied to different datasets with evaluation metrics.

3. **Lab 3: Clustering Experiment**  
   - Exploration of clustering algorithms to uncover hidden patterns in data.

## Structure
- `Lab1/`: Code and report for the regression experiment.
- `Lab2/`: Code and report for the classification experiment.
- `Lab3/`: Code and report for the clustering experiment.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
